# ProjectsWithPython
Cool projects and solved problems using python


## time with words:

Its a cool project explained in basic and intermediate level, to tell the time in natural language, when the time is provided in numbers.
You can use the template to change to your own natural language, following the rules.

This project was first intented to solve a challenge from HackerRank, (using the shorter method), but  I performed a solution for a begginer programmer, so is more understandable.

If you are a more experienced programmer, you can follow the commented lines for the solution.
